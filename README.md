# fluidnet - a flow Analysis Library

(Note: this readme is autogenerated)

This library provides tools for modeling and analyzing fluid flow in directed networks. It is designed for scenarios where the edges represent physical connections (e.g., pipes) with associated parameters (e.g., length, diameter, resistance), and nodes represent points where flows converge or diverge.

## Features

- Represent a network as a directed graph using `networkx`.
- Calculate node heads (pressure) and edge flows based on boundary conditions.
- Propagate rates and heads through the network.
- Support for single-inflow and single-outflow networks.
- Flexible handling of boundary conditions for heads and rates.

## Installation

To use the library, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `networkx`

## Usage

### Example: Basic Network Setup

```python
from src.fluid_functions import single_phase_head_gradient
from src.network import Network

# Define edges as (node1, node2, edge_data)
edges = [
    ('A', 'B', {'length': 10, 'diameter': 0.5}),
    ('B', 'C', {'length': 5, 'diameter': 0.5}),
]

# Define node attributes
node_attributes = {
    'A': {'elevation': 10},
    'C': {'elevation': 0},
}

# Initialize the network
network = Network(edges, node_attributes)

# Set boundary conditions
network.set_boundary_conditions(
    head_bc={'A': 100},  # Head at node A
    rate_bc={'C': -10},  # Flow rate out of node C
)

# Calculate node heads and edge flows
Hs = network.balance()
print("Node Heads:", Hs)
```

### Key Methods

#### `propagate_rates`
Propagates flow rates through the network and optionally calculates node heads.

```python
node_rates, edge_rates, node_heads = network.propagate_rates(rate_bc={'A': 50}, H0=0)
```

#### `balance`
Balances the network based on boundary conditions and solves for node heads.

```python
Hs = network.balance()
```

#### `get_node_flows`
Calculates the inflow and outflow for each node based on edge flows.

```python
edge_flows = [10, -10]  # Example flows through edges
flow_in, flow_out = network.get_node_flows(edge_flows)
```

#### `get_head_from_edge_rates`
Computes node heads based on edge rates and an end head value.

```python
node_heads = network.get_head_from_edge_rates(edge_rates={'A': 10, 'B': -10}, end_head=100)
```

## Tests

Tests are written using `pytest`. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Common Parameters
Common edge parameters (e.g., fluid density, viscosity) can be shared across all edges:

```python
common_params = {
    'density': 1000,
    'viscosity': 0.001,
}
network = Network(edges, common_parameters=common_params)
```

### Debugging
Enable debug mode to get verbose outputs during calculations:

```python
network = Network(edges, debug=True)
```
